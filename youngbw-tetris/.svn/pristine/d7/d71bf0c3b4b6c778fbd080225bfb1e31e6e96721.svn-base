View Side Panel:

	Toggles the side panel's visibility. When this option is not selected the next piece to drop,
	the score, number of lines cleared, and the level, as well as the theme picture will be hidden
	from view.
	
	This view enables a simplified view of the game, removing the background image and other
	distracting stimuli from the users view.
	
Scoring:

	Levels will advance every 10 lines cleared.
	
	5 points multiplied by the level per line cleared gained if less than three lines
	
	double the normal amount of points gained if the user cleared 4 lines
	
	Points equal to the level for each piece dropped successfully
	
	As time goes on and levels go up the game will move faster and faster, so rack up those points quick!
